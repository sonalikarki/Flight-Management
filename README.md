# Flight-Management
The project flight management system can be used to handle transactions in a flight travel agency
Java is used as the front end of the project while MySQL as the backend. The application can perform the basic operations needed in a travel agency such as addition of flight details and passengers details along with their flight details. The application takes the details of passengers with their flight itinerary as an input and this helps generate specific reports of flight travels on particular dates. 
The application has been programmed such the it takes minimum input from the user and gives maximum output. Tooltips , keyboard shortcuts , visual feedback , use of conventional icons and words makes the program user friendly. The front end also provides a facility to authenticate users by providing a login screen.

1.	A login frame which ensures only authorized personnel are allowed access.
2.	The flight frame through which flight details can be entered.
3.	The passeneger frame through which passengers details with their flight itinerary can be entered.
